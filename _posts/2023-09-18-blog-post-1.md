Did the Canadian wildfires have an effect on bird migration? 
======
I was running down Riverside Drive when I received a push notification on my phone: "**Emergenc--** Current health guidance suggests wearing properly fitted, high-quality masks (e.g., N95 or KN95) when outdoors to help reduce exposure and to limit outdoor activity as much as possible." 
On the 9th of June the smoke from the Canadian wildfires had spread around New York City in a thick blanket of barbecue-smelling orange tint, turning the Big Apple into a post-apocalyptical landscape. 
An avid birder and outdoor enthusiast, I had planned to bring a good friend on mine visiting me that week on a hike in Upstate New York: we were told that the air quality especially in altitude would be a problem. I had a thought that where the wildfires spread was likely where a lot of wildlife lived, especially in the summer nesting/breeding period. 



I went back home to France and didn't think much back on it. However recently I stumbled upon the following article: [Audubon: How do wildfires Canadas Boreal forest affect birds across continent](https://www.audubon.org/news/how-do-wildfires-canadas-boreal-forest-affect-birds-across-continent). This summer was recorded as the worst wildfires season recorded (since 1983). 
The article did quench some of my internal mullings as fires are not inherently bad for wildlife. In fact, I knew that wildfires were part of a cycle for forest regeneration since I was thirteen when I was told on a trip to the native forests of Australia by a friend of my parents. I remember about watching a BBC clip on fire lilies blooming out of the ashes of wildfires in South Africa.  However these wildfires were clearly the result of climate change, occurring in a scope and at times unpredicted. But it raises the same questions I was wondering: what if the fires stroke during nesting season? What if they displaced species of birds?  What becomes of them? Will they succomb to predation more easily? Will they struggle to nourish their chicks? But mostly, how much of a danger is the smoke? As we are admonished to stay at home and limit our outings, what of the birds migrating through the thick smokes? 


Although I have no biology/ornithology training. I want to answer those questions myself, and using the only tools I have: a computer and heaps of data across the internet.

Case study: 1995's wildfires

The Audubon article mentions that 2023 (at the time of the writing) was the 2nd worse fire ever recorded in the Canada boreal forests. Now after the wildfires season, we know that more than 17 million hectares were burnt down compared to the 1995 record standing at 7 millions.
